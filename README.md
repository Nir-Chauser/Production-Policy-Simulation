# Production-Policy-Simulation
Production Policy Simulation

This repository contains a discrete-event simulation project that compares two production policies in a manufacturing system.

The project focuses on production planning and control, with the goal of determining which policy leads to shorter order processing times and shorter waiting times.

Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to compare two production policies and evaluate which one performs better over time.

The research question is:

Which production policy should be chosen so that the processing time of orders will be shorter?

Production Policies

The simulation compares two alternatives:

Policy A

Each production team specializes in a specific type of pipe.

Policy B

Each production team can work on all types of pipes.

In Policy B, jobs are assigned using the SPT rule — Shortest Processing Time first.

Files Description
Production Policy Simulation.ipynb

The main Jupyter Notebook of the project.
It contains the simulation model, experiments, results, and analysis comparing the production policies.

SimClasses.py

Contains the main simulation classes, including event calendar, queues, resources, entities, and statistics collectors.

SimFunctions.py

Contains helper functions for initializing the simulation, scheduling events, and clearing statistics between simulation runs.

SimRNG.py

Contains random number generation and random-variate generation functions used in the simulation.

Project_Group09_דוב וויזמן וניר צ'אוסר.pptx

The project presentation.
It explains the background, research question, assumptions, simulation results, conclusions, and follow-up questions.

Main Conclusion

Based on the simulation results, Policy A is preferable in the long run.

Policy A performs better because:

Production times become shorter.
Waiting times become shorter.
The system becomes more efficient over time.
